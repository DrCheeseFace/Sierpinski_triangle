# Sierpinski_triangle
funky lil program to demonstrate order out of seaming chaos.
program requires tkinter module to be installed



program randomly places 3 destination nodes and a start node.
then randomly chooses one of the 3 destination nodes and moves half way towards it. 
this then becomes the start node.
the process repeats. what emerges is a sierpinski triangle.
